- When using Socket.Io, use emit instead of send

- you can send many things to back-end, unlimited
  whatever you want

- When you want to notify front-end something, 
    you can send function as an argument.
    So when job is done, it will execute the function.
    This function has to be the last argument.
    The code executed on front-end is executed by back-end.
